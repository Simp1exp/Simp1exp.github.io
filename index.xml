      <description>How this post is going to work? #  The intention of this post is to bring a review of the course “Exploiting and Securing Vulnerabilities in Java Applications” available on Coursera, eventually I also intend to bring some insights and some additional information. The dynamic of the post will be the same as the course, it’ll begin with an explanation about the topic, followed by a practical exercise trying to find the vulnerability, much like a CTF, and finally explain how to fix it.</description>

      <description>XSS #  What’s this? #   Cross Site Scripting or XSS is a type of injection attack. All injection attacks consist in using the input field that the application provides to entry arbitrary data. In XSS case, the arbitrary data is normally written in JavaScript, but may also include HTML, Flash, or any other type of code that the browser may execute. There are three types of XSS: Reflected, Stored and DOM-Based.</description>
